## **Overview of the School District Analysis**

	After submitting the school district analysis to the school board for review, it is found that the ninth grade scores for Thomas High School have been altered thus giving a false outcome. The school board is now requesting the analysis be redone but to exclude the altered scores. The same analysis is redone without the altered scores, on the same seven metrics. To exclude the ninth grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School, the grades are replaced with NaN. 


## **Results** Comparing the outcomes of the original analysis and the new. 

 	Prior to redoing the analysis, the math and reading scores for Thomas High School are replaced with NaN by using the follow code:

     `student_data_df.loc[(student_data_df["school_name"]=="Thomas High School") & (student_data_df["grade"]== "9th"),["reading_score"]]=np.na`

     `student_data_df.loc[(student_data_df["school_name"]=="Thomas High School") & (student_data_df["grade"]== "9th"),["math_score"]]=np.nan`
     

	* **District Summary** 
	In the original district summary the percentage for the average reading score is 81.9% and for math it is 75%.

	Once the ninth grade scores for Thomas High School are excluded, the reading scores percentage is 81.9% and for math is is 74.8%. By excluding the altered scores, only the math percentage was affected by less than 1%. If the math percentage for the new analysis was rounded up, it would equal to the math score in the original analysis.
